              <p>  
                Inequality and poverty are two serious problems in our society. Inequality is like when some people have a lot of money and others barely have enough to survive. And poverty is when you don't have access to basic things like a decent house, enough food, or healthcare.
                The sad thing is that, although we live in a world with a lot of technology and money, the gap between rich and poor continues to grow. And that doesn't just affect people who don't have much, it also causes problems in society at large.
                To resolve this, we need to make several changes. We should ensure that everyone has access to important things like education, health and fair work. And we also need to change the way we think about differences between people, such as those based on gender or race.
                The goal is to create a world where everyone has the same opportunities to live a good life. And that's not only fair, it's also better for everyone overall. Because when we are all well, society works much better.

              <p>Although the outcome of the latest crises has been very different from that taken in 2008, the truth is that poverty and social exclusion continue to be a pending problem that affects 12.3 million people in our country, according to data from the XIII Report 'The State of Poverty in Spain' by EAPN-ES.</p>
              <p>The cost of housing, the gender gap and insufficient support for families with children have become key factors in generating poverty in Spain. The recovery of families is being hampered by the effects of inflation, the price of energy, and constantly rising rents and mortgages, which prevent millions of people from having a life in decent conditions.</p>
              <p>Inequality in Spain is a significant challenge in economic, social and gender terms. The 2008 crisis left many people in a precarious economic situation, exacerbating existing disparities. Although progress has been made, gaps persist in access to education, health and employment. Gender inequality remains a problem, with pay gaps and barriers to access to leadership and security. In addition, there are forms of racial discrimination and difficulties for people with disabilities. Addressing this inequality requires continued and coordinated efforts to achieve equitable and sustainable development.</p>
